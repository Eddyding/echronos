# Motivation

Currently, the two tools `x.py` and `prj.py` use the pystache Python package.
This package is located under the `prj` directory and requires the `x.py` tool to manipulate the Python search path for packages to be able to import it.
If pystache was located under the `external_tools` directory, both tools could import it based on this common package directory.
This would also improve consistency with other 3rd party Python packages.


# Goals

- The pystache package may be updated to the most recent version.
- To improve the consistency of how 3rd party Python packages are managed, the pystache package shall be moved out of the `prj` directory into the `external_tools` directory.
- The `x.py` and `prj.py` shall be updated to be able to import pystache from the new location.
- The build process for the `prj` utility shall be updated so that it continues to include the pystache package in the `prj` executable.


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
- To build the `prj` executable and test its functionality, run the following commands:

    ./x.py build prj
    ./prj_build/prj build posix.acamar

- Verify that both commands complete successfully.
  This verifies that the `prj` executable correctly includes and uses pystache.
