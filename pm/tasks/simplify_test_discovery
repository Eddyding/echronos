# Motivation

The _xunittest_ Python module implements a test discovery mechanism that extends on the default logic in the _unittest_ package included in the Python standard library.
However, the extra functionality provided by _xunittest_ is largely unused and easily replaced with _unittest_ standard functionality.
Removing the _xunittest_ module helps to reduce the maintenance effort for the project.


# Goals

- remove the _xunittest_ Python module
- where necessary, replace it with functionality from the _unittest_ package


# Test Plan

- all existing regression tests must pass
- ensure that the same number of regression tests are executed on this and the upstream branch
- code review
