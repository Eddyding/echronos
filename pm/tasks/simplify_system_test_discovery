# Motivation

The command `x.py test systems` currently discovers system tests by searching for Python files that are accompanied by `gdb` files.
Compared to standard test discovery as per the unittest Python package, this limits system tests to `gdb` based tests and makes it difficult to sub-class the GdbTestCase class.


# Goals

- The `x.py` tool shall discover system tests via the standard test discovery implemented by the unittest Python package.


# Test Plan

- Verify that all existing regression tests pass.
- Verify that the changes meet the task goals and follow project conventions.
